Scrapyard Armories is a mod that adds a set of semi competently combined ships built from the salvage of other craft to the main factions of the game Current ship list is 3 capitals, 7 cruisers, and 5 destroyers alongside 3 wings.

Many of the ships feature generous weapon arcs and high flexibility, allowing them to fill a wide variety of roles as needed. weapons, hullmods, and custom ship systems will be added later on, I don't want to delay it for the long process that will come of those.
